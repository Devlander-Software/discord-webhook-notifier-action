## Security Best Practices

When using this action, please follow these security guidelines:

### Webhook Security

- **Never commit webhook URLs** to your repository
- **Use GitHub Secrets** to store your Discord webhook URL
- **Rotate webhook URLs** periodically
- **Use dedicated webhooks** for different projects/environments

### Repository Security

- **Review workflow permissions** - Only grant necessary permissions
- **Use branch protection rules** to prevent unauthorized changes
- **Enable security scanning** for your repository

### Action Usage

- **Pin action versions** to specific releases (e.g., `@v1.0.0`) rather than using `@main`
- **Review action source code** before using in production
- **Monitor action logs** for any unexpected behavior

## Disclosure Policy

1. **Private disclosure** - We'll work with you privately to fix the issue
2. **Coordinated disclosure** - We'll coordinate the public disclosure with you
3. **Credit acknowledgment** - We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
